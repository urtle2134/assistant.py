One of the biggest challenges during this project was honestly just getting the speech to text to work, I had never tried to do something like that so it took a lot of research to get it done but I believe that I have a decent enough finalized project.
My biggest idea for future improvement would be to either get the bot do more things or to just clean up the code a bit.
